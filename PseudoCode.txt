Potential Number solutions:

Have a set of numbers and totals, randomize which set and total are used, randomize the number associated with a button
I think I'll go with this one, even if it is somewhat of a copout
    Randomize which solution will be used
        select randomly a single set from the associated set of potential solutions
        randomize which number goes in which button
        PRIME NUMBERS MAY BE USEFUL HERE

Build down from the randomized total

Build up from the randomized components
